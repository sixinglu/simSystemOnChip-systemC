# simSystemOnChip-systemC
SoC simulation, includes one core, memory, bus, hardware, traffic model

This simulation platform simulate software and hardware partition with systemC.
The simulation can evaluate the execution performance when partitioning part of software into hardware execution.
The simulation can evaluate the traffic load to the performance.

argument: sim mem_init.txt 20

sim: project name.
mem_init.txt: memory initialization file
20: traffic generation period
